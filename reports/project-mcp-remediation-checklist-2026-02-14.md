# MCP Remediation Checklist (2026-02-14)

Source audit: `/Users/jeffreyvonrotz/Projects/norwegian-law-mcp/reports/project-mcp-compliance-audit-2026-02-14.json`

Execution rule: close all Wave 1 items before Wave 2; close all Wave 2 before Wave 3.

Global baseline to apply in every active MCP repo:
- [ ] Add tool annotations (`title`, `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`) to all tools
- [ ] Add/refresh `PRIVACY.md` and link it in `README.md`
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section and 3+ prompt examples in `README.md`
- [ ] Add testing account/sample-data section for directory reviewers
- [ ] Verify manifest/runtime tool parity and fix mismatches
- [ ] Confirm Streamable HTTP for remote endpoints and document auth mode
